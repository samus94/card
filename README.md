# Try The New Tic Tac Special!

Quarantine can be tough, so why not enjoy it with your friends? Oh...wait. Well you can always play with yourself. 
Rules are simple, each "player" takes turns clicking on the grid, and each click will generate either an "O" or an "X". Put three of the same in a row and you win. Feel free to keep track of your score at the top right hand. 


# 1. Development:
Languages Used: Html, CSS, Javascript

Planning: Started by drawing a basic layout of what the game would look like on paper to get a rough idea of where I wanted things to be and what I wanted the background to be. Coding began with HTML by setting the blocks needed for each item and colorcoding them and using them as placeholders. Particular attention was paid to the table and the tic tac special grid it contained. 

Javascript began with creating variables and tying them to elements needed to allow a function to work as intended. When it came to using CSS to style the actual layout, the majority of the time was spent using the broswer console and element selector to identify and solve problems, as well as to achieve the planned layout from the earliest stage of designing the Tic Tac Special. 
          
In order to keep things simple, Knight Randy and the arms for the first person point of view were created through a separate photo-editing program. The hands in particular were cut out of the background they originally came in so as to achieve transparaency and allow the background to show. 
  
A large focus was put on using shades of orange and white. In the case of the Tic Tac Special, ivory and orange were chosen. Other colors chosen were for the table, with a darker shade of brown used for the "3D effect" due to the angle of the first person view. 
   
# 2. Problems and Challenges: 

Problems revolved predominantly around styling,positioning, and conficting elements. Working out Javascript functions and syntax were more easily handled. By not being more deliberate with establishing the skeleton of the webpage, I ended up jumping between different elements and adjusting them individually. 

# 3. Lessons Learned:
When it comes to building HTML, it would have behooved me to be more specific with positioning divs, headers, and sections on a broad spectrum to handle what they would contain in order to make positioning more specific elements an easier process. By working from the largest container, the body, I would then slowly move on to more specific elements in increasing order without getting overwhelmed.
